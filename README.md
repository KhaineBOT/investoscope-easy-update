# Investoscope Easy Update

Updates [Investoscope 3](http://www.investoscope.com/) end of day quotes from
different data sources than Yahoo, Google and some other places.

Primarily it supports [Yahoo](http://www.yahoo.com/) as a data source and
it shouldn't be too much work extending it to other local data sources which may
be updated faster after the local market closes than Yahoo does.

simply open a git issue.

You will need python 3 installed, you should do this using either homebrew or
the official python installer. 

The method is totally against all TOSs for these services, however the method
emulates you manually browsing to these sites -- we also are extremely concientious
about the data requests and download minimal data. These providers are within their
best interests to impliment anti-botting measures therefore I must stress that
*THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GUARENTEE THAT THE DATA IS ACCURATE*.
